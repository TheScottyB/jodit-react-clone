# Security Best Practices

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in this project for PNPM package management.

## Package Management Security

### PNPM Configuration (v10.11.0)
- **Strict Peer Dependencies**: Ensures all peer dependencies are explicitly declared
- **Verify Store Integrity**: Validates package contents against checksums
- **Shell Safe Scripts**: Prevents arbitrary code execution in install scripts
- **Audit Level**: Set to "high" to catch critical vulnerabilities
- **Resolution Mode**: Uses highest versions to get security patches
- **Lockfile Security**: Enforces strict lockfile usage
- **Version Management**: Uses Volta for consistent tooling versions

### Environment-Specific Settings
- Development environment: Lower audit level for faster iteration
- Staging environment: Moderate audit level with script restrictions
- Production environment: Strict audit level with frozen dependencies

### Access Control
- Restricted package access
- Always requires authentication
- Uses secure registry connections
- Implements retry limits for failed fetches
- Environment-specific security rules

### Dependency Management
- Automated security audits via `pnpm audit`
- Integration with Snyk for vulnerability scanning
- Dependency verification and cleaning
- Enforces PNPM usage with `preinstall` hook
- Workspace configuration for proper peer dependency handling

## Security Scripts

```bash
# Run security audit
pnpm run security:check

# Fix security issues
pnpm run security:fix

# Check for unused dependencies
pnpm run security:dependencies
```

## CI/CD Security Measures
- Automated security checks in CI pipeline
- Dependency verification before builds
- Integrity validation of dependencies
- Secure environment variable handling
- Proper secret management
- Dependency caching security
- Build isolation enforcement

## Best Practices for Developers

1. **Tool Versioning**
   - Use PNPM v10.11.0
   - Managed through Volta
   - Consistent across all environments

2. **Always use PNPM**
   - Project enforces PNPM usage
   - Run `pnpm install` for dependencies
   - Use `--frozen-lockfile` in CI

3. **Security Checks**
   - Run security:check before commits
   - Review audit reports
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Monitor Snyk reports

4. **Version Control**
   - Never commit .env files
   - Keep lockfile in version control
   - Review dependency changes
   - Follow security workflow

5. **Development Process**
   - Use exact versions for dependencies
   - Regular security audits
   - Review security advisories
   - Follow environment-specific rules

## Environment Configuration

### Development (.npmrc.development)
```ini
audit-level=low
shell-safe-scripts=true
```

### Staging (.npmrc.staging)
```ini
audit-level=moderate
shell-safe-scripts=true
ignore-scripts=true
```

### Production (.npmrc.production)
```ini
audit-level=high
shell-safe-scripts=true
ignore-scripts=true
prefer-frozen-lockfile=true
verify-store-integrity=true
```

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:
1. Opening a draft security advisory
2. Emailing security@[project-domain].com
3. Do not disclose publicly until patched

## Regular Maintenance

- Weekly security audits
- Monthly dependency updates
- Quarterly security review
- Continuous monitoring
- Version compliance checks
