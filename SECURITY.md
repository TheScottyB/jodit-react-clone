# Security Best Practices

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in this project for PNPM package management.

## Package Management Security

### PNPM Configuration
- **Strict Peer Dependencies**: Ensures all peer dependencies are explicitly declared
- **Verify Store Integrity**: Validates package contents against checksums
- **Shell Safe Scripts**: Prevents arbitrary code execution in install scripts
- **Audit Level**: Set to "high" to catch critical vulnerabilities
- **Resolution Mode**: Uses highest versions to get security patches
- **Lockfile Security**: Enforces strict lockfile usage

### Access Control
- Restricted package access
- Always requires authentication
- Uses secure registry connections
- Implements retry limits for failed fetches

### Dependency Management
- Automated security audits via `pnpm audit`
- Integration with Snyk for vulnerability scanning
- Dependency verification and cleaning
- Enforces PNPM usage with `preinstall` hook

## Security Scripts

```bash
# Run security audit
pnpm run security:check

# Fix security issues
pnpm run security:fix

# Check for unused dependencies
pnpm run security:dependencies
```

## CI/CD Security Measures
- Automated security checks in CI pipeline
- Dependency verification before builds
- Integrity validation of dependencies
- Secure environment variable handling

## Best Practices for Developers

1. **Always use PNPM**
   - Project enforces PNPM usage
   - Run `pnpm install` for dependencies

2. **Security Checks**
   - Run security:check before commits
   - Review audit reports
   - Keep dependencies updated

3. **Version Control**
   - Never commit .env files
   - Keep lockfile in version control
   - Review dependency changes

4. **Development Process**
   - Use exact versions for dependencies
   - Regular security audits
   - Review security advisories

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it by:
1. Opening a draft security advisory
2. Emailing security@[project-domain].com
3. Do not disclose publicly until patched

## Regular Maintenance

- Weekly security audits
- Monthly dependency updates
- Quarterly security review
- Continuous monitoring
