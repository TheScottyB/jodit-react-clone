current_version=$(node -v | cut -c2-)

function version_lt() { 
  test "$(echo "$@" | tr " " "\n" | sort -rV | head -n 1)" != "$1"; 
}

if version_lt "$current_version" "$required_version"; then
  echo "Error: Node.js version $current_version is below required version $required_version"
  echo "Please upgrade Node.js or use nvm to switch to a compatible version"
  exit 1
fi

# Check for npm compatibility issues
npm_warnings=$(npm --version 2>&1 | grep -i "does not support" || true)
if [ ! -z "$npm_warnings" ]; then
  echo "Warning: Potential npm compatibility issue detected"
  echo "$npm_warnings"
  echo "Consider running: npm install -g npm@latest"
fi

echo "Node.js version $current_version is compatible"
EOF

chmod +x ./scripts/validate-node.sh
```

### 10.3 Validation Dependencies Matrix

The following matrix shows the dependencies between validation activities:

| Validation Activity | Prerequisites | Blockers for | Priority |
|---------------------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Node.js Compatibility | None | Build System, Testing | Critical |
| Database Implementation | Environment Setup | Data Persistence Tests | High |
| Webhook Security | API Access | Integration Tests | High |
| Unit Test Completion | Code Fixes | Test Coverage Reports | Medium |
| Integration Tests | Unit Tests, Environment | Performance Tests | Medium |
| Performance Benchmarks | Integration Tests | Optimization | Low |
| Security Audit | All Implementation | Final Approval | Critical |

### 10.4 Validation Workflow

The validation workflow follows this process:

1. **Environment Preparation**
   - Validate Node.js compatibility
   - Set up development environment
   - Configure testing tools

2. **Component Validation**
   - Unit testing (isolated components)
   - Integration testing (component interactions)
   - End-to-end testing (complete workflows)

3. **Performance Validation**
   - Benchmark critical operations
   - Validate against performance targets
   - Identify optimization opportunities

4. **Security Validation**
   - Dependency audit
   - Authentication and authorization review
   - Webhook security validation

5. **Documentation Validation**
   - Technical review
   - User documentation review
   - Process documentation review

### 10.5 Rollback Procedures

In case validation fails, the following rollback procedures are in place:

```bash
# Create rollback script for database changes
cat > ./scripts/rollback-db.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Rollback database changes to a specific version

DB_VERSION=${1:-"previous"}
echo "Rolling back database to version: $DB_VERSION"

if [ "$DB_VERSION" = "previous" ]; then
  npx knex migrate:down
else
  npx knex migrate:down --to=$DB_VERSION
fi

echo "Database rollback complete"
EOF

chmod +x ./scripts/rollback-db.sh

# Create code version rollback script
cat > ./scripts/rollback-code.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Rollback code to a specific commit or tag

TARGET=${1:-"HEAD~1"}
BRANCH=${2:-"$(git branch --show-current)"}

echo "Rolling back code to: $TARGET on branch $BRANCH"

git checkout $BRANCH
git reset --hard $TARGET

echo "Code rollback complete"
EOF

chmod +x ./scripts/rollback-code.sh
```

### 10.6 Sign-off Checklist
