current_version=$(node -v | cut -c2-)

function version_lt() { 
  test "$(echo "$@" | tr " " "\n" | sort -rV | head -n 1)" != "$1"; 
}

if version_lt "$current_version" "$required_version"; then
  echo "Error: Node.js version $current_version is below required version $required_version"
  echo "Please upgrade Node.js or use nvm to switch to a compatible version"
  exit 1
fi

# Check for npm compatibility issues
npm_warnings=$(npm --version 2>&1 | grep -i "does not support" || true)
if [ ! -z "$npm_warnings" ]; then
  echo "Warning: Potential npm compatibility issue detected"
  echo "$npm_warnings"
  echo "Consider running: npm install -g npm@latest"
