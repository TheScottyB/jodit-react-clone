# Jodit React - Project Summary

## Purpose and Context

This project represents more than just a Jodit React wrapper - it's a demonstration of rapid modernization capabilities applied to legacy code. What began as a 5-year-old demo project has been completely revitalized overnight as a proof of capability, showcasing the ability to quickly modernize and enhance outdated repositories with modern technologies and practices.

### Square-Spocket Integration Connection

This modernization effort ties directly to a practical business need: integrating Square's inventory system with online websites, particularly addressing the synchronization and routing challenges complicated by third-party services like Spocket. Spocket is widely recognized as a problematic integration for many users, and this project serves as a foundation for building a flexible, robust Spocket-Square integration.

### Specific Integration Challenges

The Square-Spocket integration faces several challenging technical hurdles that this project aims to address:

- **OAuth Token Management**: Secure handling and refresh of access tokens between systems, with proper token rotation and expiration management
- **Catalog Synchronization**: Bidirectional product data synchronization with conflict resolution strategies for competing updates
- **Inventory Discrepancies**: Resolution of inventory count differences that arise from asynchronous operations and race conditions
- **Visibility Chain Management**: Maintaining consistent product visibility across platforms despite differing visibility models
- **Order Routing Logic**: Intelligent routing of orders between fulfillment systems based on inventory source and availability
- **Webhook Event Processing**: Reliable processing of real-time events with proper idempotency and failure recovery

### Visibility Chain Management

A core technical challenge involves managing item visibility across integrated platforms. The Square catalog utilizes a sophisticated visibility chain model where:

- Items inherit visibility properties from their parent categories
- Visibility changes cascade through dependent objects
- Visibility states include PRIVATE, PUBLIC, and various conditional states
- Synchronization requires mapping between Square's visibility model and Spocket's publication states

This project implements sophisticated visibility translation algorithms that maintain consistency across both platforms while respecting each system's constraints.

### Relationship with Broader Square Inventory Project

This Jodit React component sits alongside a larger Square inventory synchronization project in the local repository. By demonstrating rapid modernization capabilities through this component, we establish a technical foundation that will be applied to solve the more complex integration issues in the main project. The techniques and approaches used here directly inform how we'll tackle the larger challenges of inventory synchronization between Square and third-party platforms.

## Integration Notes

The project includes integration capabilities with Square's Web SDK, specifically designed to address:

- E-commerce content synchronization between Square and third-party platforms
- Product descriptions and inventory management across systems
- Payment form customization and order routing
- Order management with special handling for Spocket-sourced products
- Resolving synchronization issues between Square inventory and dropshipping services

### OAuth Token Management

- Securely stores access and refresh tokens in encrypted storage
- Automatically refreshes tokens before expiration
- Implements proper rotation policies for security compliance
- Handles token revocation and reauthorization flows
- Provides monitoring for token usage and health

### Catalog Synchronization Architecture

The catalog synchronization system employs a sophisticated architecture:

- **Change Detection**: Identifies changes on either platform using webhooks and polling
- **Differential Sync**: Transmits only changed properties rather than entire objects
- **Conflict Resolution**: Applies configurable rules to resolve competing updates
- **Idempotent Operations**: Ensures repeated operations produce consistent results
